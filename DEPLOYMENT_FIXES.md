# Deployment Fixes for Baakh Project

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AdminDashboard Loading State Issue
- **Problem**: AdminDashboard showing `loading: true` and `stats: false`
- **Root Cause**: Missing Supabase environment variables in production
- **Solution**: Added fallback mock data when Supabase is not configured

### 2. Poet Page "Not Found" After Deployment
- **Problem**: Poet pages showing "poet not found" after deployment
- **Root Cause**: Backend API dependency and missing environment variables
- **Solution**: Added direct database connection with API fallback

## Required Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Required)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# Backend API Configuration (Optional - for legacy backend)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-api.com

# Next.js Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Add the above environment variables to your deployment platform
2. **Redeploy**: Trigger a new deployment after setting the environment variables
3. **Test**: Verify that both admin dashboard and poet pages work correctly

## Testing

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `/admin` - Should show admin dashboard with stats
- `/poets/[slug]` - Should show poet profile pages
- `/api/admin/stats` - Should return admin statistics

## Fallback Behavior

- If Supabase is not configured, admin stats will show zeros instead of failing
- If backend API is not available, poet pages will try direct database connection
- If both fail, appropriate error messages will be shown to users
