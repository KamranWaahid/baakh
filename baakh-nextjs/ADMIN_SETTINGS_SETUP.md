# Admin Settings Setup Guide

## 🎯 Current Status

The admin settings page is **fully functional** and working with test endpoints. The frontend provides a complete settings management experience with:

- ✅ Profile Settings (Name, email, phone, bio)
- ✅ Security Settings (Password change, 2FA, session timeout)
- ✅ Notification Settings (Email, push, SMS, reports)
- ✅ System Settings (Language, timezone, theme, backup)

## 🔧 Database Setup Required

To enable production database functionality, you need to fix the RLS (Row Level Security) permissions.

### Step 1: Fix RLS Permissions

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Run the following SQL script:

```sql
-- Fix RLS permissions for admin_settings table
GRANT ALL ON admin_settings TO service_role;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO service_role;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own settings" ON admin_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own settings" ON admin_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own settings" ON admin_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own settings" ON admin_settings;

-- Create policy for service role
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all settings" ON admin_settings
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Create user-specific policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own settings" ON admin_settings
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own settings" ON admin_settings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own settings" ON admin_settings
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own settings" ON admin_settings
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup

After running the SQL, test the setup:

```bash
# Test the status endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/settings/status"

# Test production endpoints
node test-production-settings.js
```

You should see `"production_ready": true` in the response.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Smart Fallback System

The settings page automatically detects whether the production database is ready:

1. **Production Ready**: Uses `/api/admin/settings/production` endpoints
2. **Not Ready**: Falls back to `/api/admin/settings/test` endpoints
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if production fails

### API Endpoints

#### Test Endpoints (Currently Active)
- `GET /api/admin/settings/test?userId={id}` - Load settings
- `POST /api/admin/settings/test` - Save settings

#### Production Endpoints (After RLS fix)
- `GET /api/admin/settings/production?userId={id}` - Load settings
- `POST /api/admin/settings/production` - Save settings
- `DELETE /api/admin/settings/production` - Reset settings

#### Status Endpoint
- `GET /api/admin/settings/status` - Check database readiness

## 📁 File Structure

```
src/app/admin/settings/
├── page.tsx                    # Main settings page (smart fallback)
├── api/
│   ├── settings/
│   │   ├── route.ts           # Original production API
│   │   ├── test/route.ts      # Test endpoints (working)
│   │   ├── production/route.ts # Production endpoints
│   │   ├── status/route.ts    # Database status check
│   │   └── password/route.ts  # Password change API
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Current Functionality
```bash
# Test settings page
curl "http://localhost:3000/admin/settings"

# Test API endpoints
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/settings/test?userId=test-user"
```

### Test After RLS Fix
```bash
# Check status
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/settings/status"

# Test production endpoints
node test-production-settings.js
```

## 🔄 Switching to Production

Once RLS permissions are fixed:

1. The settings page will automatically detect production readiness
2. It will switch from test endpoints to production endpoints
3. All data will be saved to the `admin_settings` table
4. Settings will persist across sessions

## 🎉 Features

### Notification Settings
- Email notifications
- Push notifications
- SMS notifications
- Weekly reports
- System alerts
- User activity notifications

### System Settings
- Language selection (English, Sindhi, Urdu)
- Timezone configuration
- Date/Time format preferences
- Theme selection (Light, Dark, System)
- Auto backup settings
- Backup frequency

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Error
If you see "permission denied for table admin_settings":
1. Run the RLS fix SQL script
2. Verify the service role has proper permissions
3. Check that policies are created correctly

### Network Issues
If you see "fetch failed" errors:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
3. Ensure the development server is running

### Settings Not Saving
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are responding
3. Check database permissions

## 📝 Notes

- The settings page works perfectly with test endpoints
- Production database integration requires RLS permission fix
- All validation and UI functionality is complete
- Smart fallback ensures the page always works
- TypeScript provides full type safety

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Run the RLS fix SQL script in Supabase
2. Test the production endpoints
3. Verify settings persist in the database
4. Enjoy your fully functional admin settings page!
